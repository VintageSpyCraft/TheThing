                              The Thing was originally mounted inside The Great Seal, however, I wanted my version to be touched, taken down, disassembled when
                              the curious ask about it, and then quickly mounted back on the wall.

                              So my version is mounted to a plinth, which has an embedded magnet. The Thing
                              also has an embedded magnet so it securely snaps into place

                	I got in contact with a few different CNC shops, unfortunately they weren't able to help.
I would love to have done this myself, I like the look of the <a href="https://www.bantamtools.com">Bantam Tools CNC</a>
but it's out of my range for a small project. In the end I went with Shapeways for the main body
assembly.

      a coke cake is thicker than that, also I need something to measure it

                	Call me crazy, but the antenna that "The Thing" had was very thing and had a flattened head,
      I again didn't know how I was going to make it at this point, so I had one made in a non-conductive
      aluminium, the finish on the piece is terrible, and it's very easy to bend.
      
      Note the units pieces screwed together great

      The original was hidden inside the seal, but I wanted to show mine off. I wanted to show
      the old with the new, maybe a bright plinth?
